    <strong>Tinktime Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Tinktime, an experience that lets you express yourself and share with friends or loved ones in a new, fun and more personal way. With Tinktime, every
    exchange is less about reading words on a screen and more about making a genuine connection.
</p>
<p>
    Tinktime enables you to send messages to friends – or anyone else in your life – to say that you are thinking of them, express your gratitude or celebrate
    someone you care about.
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how Tinktime AB (“Tinktime”, “we”, and “us”) collect, use, and share your information whenever you use our website or
    application (our “Services”). We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our services or transacting business with us. By using our
    services you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <strong>1. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Depending on which Services you use, we collect different kinds of information from or about you:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>User Provided Information</strong>
        : You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your mobile phone number, push notification name (if applicable), billing
        information (if applicable) and mobile device information (including hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers MAC
        address and IMEI, browser type and language, mobile device phone number, and mobile network information) to Tinktime when choosing to participate in
        various uses of the Tinktime Service, such as registering as a user and message or communicate with others.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Usage Information</strong>
        : We collect information about your activity and the messages you send and receive through our Services. For example, we collect information such as
        the time, date, sender, recipient of a message, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the
        most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cookies Information and other tracking technologies</strong>
        : Like most online services, we use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device
        memory that store information about your use of the Services, which can, among other things, help us see which areas and features of the Services are
        popular and let us count visits. Tinktime use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close
        your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Web beacons
        are small pieces of software on a webpage or email that help us track your use of our service and to deliver or communicate with cookies. Most web
        browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Keep in
        mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Website Log File Information</strong>
        : We collect log file information when you use our websites. That information includes, among other things, your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”)
        address, browser type and language, access times, pages viewed, and the website you visited before navigating to our websites
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. What kinds of information do we collect from other sources?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If another user allows us to collect information from his or her device phonebook—and you’re one of that user’s contacts—we may combine the information we
    collect from that user’s phonebook with other information we have collected about you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. How do we use this information?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide you with amazing features and functionality of services:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Deliver and improve our products, services and functionality, and manage our business;
    </li>
    <li>
        Manage your account and provide you with customer support;
    </li>
    <li>
        Communicate with you. That means just what it says; we may send you marketing communications on behalf of us or third parties; respond to your comments
        and questions; provide customer service; and send you technical notices, security alerts, and other informational messages;
    </li>
    <li>
        Monitor, perform research and analyze trends and usage;
    </li>
    <li>
        Personalize the services by providing content, features and advertisements that match user profiles or interests;

        services, such as to prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity; and
    </li>
    <li>
        Perform functions or services as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>4. How is this information shared?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Here’s the type of information we may share about you with others and how we do so:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Information shared with other users:</strong>
        When you send a message, your recipients will see your username and, of course, whatever your message says or shows (whether that’s an animation,
        photo, video, text, or transaction). When you view content that another Tinktime user has sent you, we will let the sender know that you saw it. When
        you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook. For
        instance, when you use Find Friends, we may share your username and name with other users who use Find Friends and have your phone number in their
        device phonebook. In these cases, we will not display your phone number to these users, but we will share the fact that your username and name are
        associated with your phone number.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
    <br/>
</p>
<ul>

<ul>

        <strong>Aggregated and/or non-personal information:</strong>
        We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you. We may combine non-personal information we
        collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We may also share it with third parties (including advisors, advertisers
        and investors) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our service and on websites or applications of third-parties, and to analyze and report
        on advertising you see. Also for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or other business purposes. You acknowledge and agree that we are
        not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every
        third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our Services.

    <strong>5. Our Commitment to Data Security</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Tinktime take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, we cannot ensure or warrant
    the security of any information you transmit to Tinktime and you do so at your own risk. Using unsecured wifi or unprotected networks to submit messages
    through the Tinktime service is never recommended. Once we receive your transmission of information, Tinktime, makes commercially reasonable efforts to
    ensure the security of our systems. If Tinktime learns of a security breach, then we attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate
    protective steps. Tinktime may post on the Tinktime Site or through the Tinktime Service if a security breach occurs.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>6. Our Commitment to Children’s' Privacy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Although our service is a general audience service, we restrict the use of our service to
    individuals age 13 and above. For that reason, Tinktime does not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from children under the age of 13.
</p>
<p>
